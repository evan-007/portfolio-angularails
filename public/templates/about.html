  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>My degree is in journalism, but I've had my hands in web-related work for a few years. I started out online as an SEO-content writer, then graduated to doing slightly-shady SEO with wordpress sites. Since about December 2013 or so, I've been hustling hard to learn Ruby on Rails, CSS and general computer skills. I once had a streak of 90 days of commits on github, in addition to working a full-time job. I've taken the Ruby on Rails and Frontend Development courses at <a href="http://thinkful">Thinkful</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm mostly interested in backend technologies and I'd love to start contributing to the open source projects I use every day once I'm a bit more experienced. </p>
  <p>I've spent the majority of the past 6 years abroad, in Europe and East Asia. I had my <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20100510000488">15-minutes</a> of <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20100601000475">fame</a> in Korea.</p>
