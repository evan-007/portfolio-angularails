"Wordy","A language-learner site built to leverage the 100 million word British National Corpus.","ESL textbooks are full of errors and awkward expressions that hinder even the most diligent student. Creating accurate and useful examples for students is incredibly time consuming. How about building practice material dynamically by using data from the British National Corpus, an online database of millions of examples of real world English usage? Users sign up, submit a list of words they want to study and then start building quizzes: either fill-in-the-blank, definition matching or word-matching. Progress is tracked and visualized using Highcharts. Google maps to see who's using the site from around the world.","https://github.com/evan-007/Wordy","http://fierce-waters-4117.herokuapp.com/"
"Umbrellas","The answer to every morning's most important question.","A series of API calls takes a user's location and let's her know if she needs to bring an umbrella when she leaves the house. Probably much better suited for a lighter framework like Sinatra, but I wanted to see how to work with rails and not use a database-backed model. It's only as accurate as forecast.io!","https://github.com/evan-007/umbrellas","http://thawing-reaches-7885.herokuapp.com/"
"OMG SHOES!","Psyched out shopping list inspired by a psyched out ex.","Do this later!","https://github.com/evan-007/omg-shoes","http://evan-007.github.io/omg-shoes/"
"Gimme Tunes","Bird's eye view of a band or artist with minimal effort.","User input gets sent off to youtube, soundcloud, instagram and echonest. The response gives a high-level overview of an artist: biographical info, soundcloud and youtube samples and instagram photos  (if the band name matches an instagram tag).","https://github.com/evan-007/news-api","http://evan-007.github.io/news-api/main.html"
"Korea Quiz","There's more to the ROK than Gangnam Style.","Built with jQuery and simple html/css, the questions are stored in javascript objects and jquery handles the quiz flow.","https://github.com/evan-007/unit-3-quiz","http://evan-007.github.io/unit-3-quiz/main.html"
"Portfolio Site","Angular on Rails for ","I wanted a backend for managing my portfolio so I could update it easily. A really simple api feeds the data to angular. I used ui-router for nesting the project views inside the portfolio view. ","https://github.com/evan-007/portfolio-angularails","http://nameless-plains-5246.herokuapp.com/"
"Ruby Scraper","Scrape the web and build a csv with test data.","I needed some seed data for a rails app idea and didn't want to use Faker. Intead, scraped some data from a similar site and dumped it into a csv. Obviously this was just for development reasons and not actually using the data in production. It's an interesting script that uses selenium to render the site's javascript and nokogiri to parse the html.","https://github.com/evan-007/do-indie-scrapper/blob/master/scrape-band-info.rb","https://github.com/evan-007/do-indie-scrapper/blob/master/scrape-band-info.rb"
"Hot or Cold","TDD in JS","A thinkful project. The design is by xxxx, the implementation is by me. Coming from rails' TDD-or-die tutorials, I really wanted to test my javascript. I ended up using casper.js, which is surprisingly like rspec/capybara integration testing.","https://github.com/evan-007/hot-or-cold-starter","http://evan-007.github.io/hot-or-cold-starter/"
"Wikiful Redux","Ugly as sin, but well tested","One of the last projects in the Thinkful Rails course is to build a TDD version of a mini-wiki site. There is zero css, but the test coverage with Rspec is pretty decent.","https://github.com/evan-007/wikiful-redux","https://github.com/evan-007/wikiful-redux"
